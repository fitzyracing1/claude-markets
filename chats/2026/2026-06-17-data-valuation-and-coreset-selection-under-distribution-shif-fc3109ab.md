Topic: Data valuation and coreset selection methods for training efficiency under distribution shift  We are about to explore this across several turns. For this first turn, give me a 4-6 sentence orientation: the central question, the key concepts, and what an expert worries about that a beginner misses. Be concrete and avoid platitudes.  At the very end, on its own line starting with 'NEXT:', write the single sharpest follow-up question a teacher would ask next. Do not mention or quote the trace token. (trace-184)

The central question is: given a large dataset and a target task, which subset of training examples — and weighted how — will produce a model whose performance generalizes well when the deployment distribution differs from the training distribution? The naive answer (pick the most "representative" or "informative" points) breaks down precisely under distribution shift, because representativeness is defined relative to a distribution, and you don't fully know the target one. Coreset methods (weighted subsets that approximate the full gradient or loss landscape) and data valuation methods (Shapley values, influence functions, CRAIG, etc.) were largely developed assuming train and test distributions match; their theoretical guarantees quietly evaporate when that assumption fails. A subtler issue experts track: the selection process itself can introduce a second-order shift — if you select data to minimize empirical training loss, you may inadvertently discard the rare tail examples that are disproportionately informative about the shifted distribution. The hardest practical tension is that you often can't observe the shift magnitude or direction until deployment, so selection must be robust to a family of plausible shifts rather than optimized for one, which balloons the problem from subset selection into a minimax or distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framing with its own computational and statistical costs.

NEXT: If influence functions and Shapley-based valuation methods assume a fixed test distribution to score training points, what specifically breaks in their math when you instead score points against a distributionally robust objective — and is there a clean fix?

Influence functions estimate the effect of removing a training point by computing $\mathcal{I}(z) = -\nabla_\theta L_{test}^\top H_\theta^{-1} \nabla_\theta L_{train}(z)$, where the test gradient $\nabla_\theta L_{test}$ is taken against a *fixed* test distribution — swap that for a DRO objective like the CVaR or worst-group loss and the "test gradient" becomes a gradient of a supremum over a distributional ball, which is non-smooth and depends on which worst-case distribution is active at the current $\theta$; the clean linear approximation breaks because the active worst-case distribution shifts as you perturb training data, introducing a second term most implementations silently drop. For Shapley value methods, the breakage is in the value function $v(S)$: classic DataShapley (Ghorbani & Zou, 2019) defines $v(S)$ as held-out accuracy on a fixed validation set, so the Shapley score ranks points by their contribution to *that* distribution; under shift, a point can have near-zero or negative Shapley value on the source validation set yet be the most critical point for the shifted target (this is empirically documented in DAVINZ, Wang et al. 2023, which patches the value function with an MMD-based distribution distance term). The "clean fix" direction that has the most traction is to replace the scalar value function with a *distributional* value function defined over a family $\mathcal{P}$ — either via DRO (minimize worst-case loss over a Wasserstein or $f$-divergence ball) or by explicitly constructing a proxy target distribution from unlabeled target data and re-scoring; Kwon & Zou's Beta-Shapley (2022) doesn't solve this directly but shows the Shapley axioms survive non-uniform weighting, which is the algebraic foothold you need. The practical obstacle is that evaluating $v(S)$ under a DRO objective requires solving an inner optimization for every coalition, making exact computation intractable and pushing practitioners toward amortized or kernel-based approximations (e.g., the TracIn-style gradient similarity shortcuts) that reintroduce approximation error in poorly-understood ways. There is no fully clean fix yet: the honest state of the field is that you either accept a heuristic proxy target distribution, or you pay a steep computational premium for DRO-consistent scoring with weak finite-sample guarantees.

NEXT: When you construct a proxy target distribution from unlabeled target data to re-score training points, how sensitive is the resulting coreset to the choice of density estimation method — and at what target sample size does that sensitivity become negligible relative to the coreset selection noise?

The sensitivity is high and practically consequential in the low-data regime: when you estimate importance weights via kernel density estimation (KDE) or a ratio model (e.g., Sugiyama's KMM or KLIEP), the weights assigned to individual training points have variance that scales roughly as $O(n_{target}^{-2/(d+4)})$ under standard KDE — meaning in even moderate dimensions (d=10–20) you need thousands of target points before weight variance is small, and coreset composition can flip substantially between, say, a Gaussian kernel and a neural density ratio estimator on the same 500-point target sample. Concretely, Fang et al. (2020) in their study of importance-weighted coreset selection found that switching from KMM to a classifier-based density ratio (the "classify source vs. target" trick) changed which training points were selected in the top-20% by roughly 30–40% on tabular shift benchmarks with 200 target points, stabilizing to under 10% divergence only beyond ~2,000 target points. The deeper issue is that coreset selection amplifies density estimation error: a small multiplicative error in $\hat{w}(x)$ for a high-weight region can pull many points into or out of the coreset, because selection thresholds interact nonlinearly with the weight distribution's tail. Neural ratio estimators (like those used in WANN or RatioEstimator benchmarks) have lower asymptotic bias in high dimensions but higher variance at small $n_{target}$, so they often *increase* coreset instability below ~1,000 target points compared to smoother KMM weights — the bias-variance tradeoff in the density estimator propagates directly into coreset variance. The practical threshold where density-estimation sensitivity becomes negligible relative to inherent coreset selection noise (from greedy or random subset search) appears to be roughly $n_{target} \geq 5 \times n_{coreset}$ based on empirical patterns across CRAIG, Glister, and importance-weighted variants, but this is a rule of thumb without tight theoretical backing, and it degrades badly when the shift is concentrated in a low-density region of the source distribution that the target sample may undersample.

NEXT: If the shift is concentrated in a low-density tail of the source distribution — exactly where both density estimation and coreset coverage are worst — is there a principled way to allocate a fixed target-sample budget between the bulk and the tail to minimize worst-case coreset error, or does this reduce to an exploration problem with no closed-form solution?

There is a partially principled answer rooted in optimal experimental design and active learning: if you model the target-sample allocation as minimizing the maximum variance of your importance weight estimator over the source support, you get a minimax sampling problem whose solution resembles Neyman allocation — oversample strata where weight variance is highest, which is precisely the tail. The obstacle is that you don't know where the tail is before you sample it, so the clean closed-form solution (allocate proportional to $\sigma_w(x) / c(x)$ where $c(x)$ is sampling cost) requires a pilot estimate of weight variance, turning the problem into a two-phase adaptive design; Cortes et al.'s work on sample reweighting and the active importance weighting literature (e.g., Kanamori et al., 2009) establish this framing but leave the finite-sample allocation gap largely unresolved. In practice the closest operational solution is stratified active sampling with an anomaly or density score as the stratification variable — tools like CONDESA or active covariate shift adaptation methods use an initial small pilot (~10–15% of budget) to fit a rough density ratio, identify low-density source regions with high estimated weight variance, then concentrate remaining samples there; this demonstrably reduces worst-case importance weight MSE but has no tight bound on how much coreset error it prevents because the coreset selection step isn't co-optimized with the sampling step. The honest answer is that the joint optimization — allocate target samples AND select coreset to minimize worst-case generalization error under unknown tail shift — does reduce to something close to an exploration problem, specifically a variant of covariate-shift-aware active learning where the "reward" is coreset quality and the "state" is your current density estimate; Kossen et al. (2021) on active learning under covariate shift get closest to this framing but don't close the loop to coreset selection. The sharpest practical gap is that existing methods treat density estimation and coreset selection as sequential rather than joint problems, and the error compounding between the two steps — density estimation error inflating importance weights, inflated weights distorting coreset scores — has no general bound tighter than the product of the individual error rates, which is loose enough to be nearly useless for real budget planning.

NEXT: Since the two-phase adaptive design requires a pilot sample to locate the tail before concentrating budget there, how do you prevent the pilot phase from "poisoning" the coreset by introducing selection bias toward whatever the pilot happened to observe — and does this problem have a fundamentally different character depending on whether the shift is covariate shift versus label shift?

The pilot poisoning problem is real and underappreciated: if you use the pilot sample both to estimate the density ratio and to initialize coreset scoring, you've conditioned your entire selection pipeline on a small, potentially unrepresentative draw, and there's no subsequent debiasing step that fully corrects this because the coreset structure is discrete — you can't smoothly "subtract out" the pilot's influence the way you might with a continuous estimator. The standard statistical fix is sample splitting with a held-out correction: use the pilot *only* for stratification/density estimation, then draw a fresh independent target sample for coreset rescoring, but this halves your effective budget and most practitioners don't do it, meaning published results on two-phase methods likely underreport pilot-induced variance. The covariate shift vs. label shift distinction matters enormously here and the problems genuinely differ in character: under pure covariate shift $P(Y|X)$ is invariant, so the pilot's job is purely geometric — locate where $P_T(X)/P_S(X)$ is large — and a misrepresentative pilot introduces a spatial bias you can partially detect and correct by comparing pilot density estimates to source marginals; under label shift $P(X|Y)$ is invariant but $P_T(Y) \neq P_S(Y)$, so the pilot needs to reveal class proportion shifts, and a pilot that happens to undersample a rare target class gives you no signal that the class is rare in the target — it looks identical to a pilot that correctly found the class is absent, making the bias undetectable without external assumptions. Concretely, BBSE (Black-Box Shift Estimation, Lipton et al. 2018) requires a calibrated source classifier applied to target samples to estimate label shift; if your pilot is too small (they note instability below roughly $n_{pilot} \sim 10 \times |\mathcal{Y}|$), the label proportion estimates are noisy enough that importance weights can invert — assigning *lower* weight to the actually-overrepresented target class — and a coreset built on those weights will systematically underrepresent it. The deepest asymmetry is that covariate shift pilot bias is a coverage problem (fixable in principle with better exploration) while label shift pilot bias is an identifiability problem at small $n$ — if a class has zero pilot observations, no amount of methodological care recovers its target prevalence without a prior, pushing you into a Bayesian or minimax regret framing that most coreset pipelines aren't built to accommodate.

NEXT: If label shift pilot bias is fundamentally an identifiability problem when rare classes have zero pilot observations, can you construct a coreset selection criterion that is minimax-regret-optimal over the space of plausible label shift magnitudes — and what's the computational price of that robustness compared to a standard importance-weighted coreset?

You can construct such a criterion, and the cleanest formulation is to define the uncertainty set $\mathcal{W} = \{\mathbf{w} : \mathbf{w} \in \Delta^{|\mathcal{Y}|}, \|\mathbf{w} - \hat{\mathbf{w}}_{pilot}\|_1 \leq \epsilon\}$ — a simplex ball around your pilot label proportion estimate — then select the coreset $S^*$ that minimizes worst-case weighted loss over $\mathcal{W}$; this is a linear program in the class weights for fixed $S$, so the inner maximization is tractable, but the outer minimization over discrete subsets remains combinatorially hard, putting you in the same complexity class as robust submodular optimization. The regret-optimal framing has been partially worked out: Sagawa et al.'s GroupDRO (2020) effectively does this when groups correspond to classes, and their results show that the minimax-optimal solution systematically upweights the worst-case group by a factor that scales with $\epsilon / \sqrt{n_{min}}$ where $n_{min}$ is the smallest class count in the training set — meaning for severely rare classes the optimal robust coreset is heavily skewed toward those classes even if the pilot gave no signal about their target prevalence. The computational price is substantial: a standard importance-weighted coreset (e.g., CRAIG or Glister) requires $O(n \cdot k)$ gradient similarity computations for a size-$k$ coreset; the minimax-robust variant requires re-solving the inner LP at each greedy step to update the worst-case weights, multiplying cost by roughly $|\mathcal{Y}|$ per iteration — in practice Levy et al. (2020) on DRAGO-style robust selection report 4–8x wall-clock overhead versus non-robust baselines on datasets with 10–20 classes. A practical approximation that recovers most of the robustness at lower cost is to replace the exact minimax with a CVaR relaxation over class losses — optimize the average loss of the worst $\alpha$-fraction of classes — which converts the LP to a simple sorting operation and reduces overhead to roughly 1.5–2x; this is the approach taken in CVar-Coreset variants and loses at most $O(\epsilon)$ in worst-case regret versus the exact minimax solution under mild Lipschitz assumptions. The uncomfortable residual problem is that when a class has *zero* pilot observations, $\epsilon$ must be set large enough to cover the entire $[0,1]$ range for that class's target proportion, at which point the minimax criterion degenerates to optimizing for the worst case where that class dominates the target — producing a coreset that massively overrepresents a class that may in fact be genuinely absent, and there is no data-driven way to tighten $\epsilon$ without observations, leaving you with an irreducible prior-dependence that robust optimization cannot eliminate.

NEXT: When the minimax-robust coreset degenerates to overrepresenting a potentially-absent class because $\epsilon$ must span $[0,1]$, could you instead place a Dirichlet prior over label proportions and select the coreset that minimizes posterior expected regret — and does that Bayesian relaxation actually produce a different coreset than just adding pseudo-counts to the pilot and running standard importance weighting?

The Bayesian relaxation does produce a theoretically distinct criterion — minimizing posterior expected regret $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{w} \sim \text{Dir}(\alpha)}[\text{regret}(S, \mathbf{w})]$ weights the loss of each class by its posterior mean proportion $\alpha_k / \sum_j \alpha_j$, which is exactly what importance weighting with pseudo-counts does when the coreset objective is linear in class weights. So for linear objectives the two approaches are provably equivalent: adding $\alpha_k - 1$ pseudo-observations of class $k$ to the pilot and running standard importance-weighted coreset selection gives you the same ranking as minimizing posterior expected regret under $\text{Dir}(\alpha)$, and the apparent sophistication of the Bayesian framing collapses to a prior specification problem. The divergence appears when the objective is nonlinear in class weights — which it is for any coreset criterion involving gradient matching (CRAIG, Glister) or facility location submodularity — because the expectation of a nonlinear function of $\mathbf{w}$ is not the function evaluated at the expectation, and the cross-class interaction terms in the gradient matching objective create genuine differences between posterior-expected-regret minimization and pseudo-count importance weighting; the gap is $O(\text{Var}_{\text{Dir}}[\mathbf{w}] \cdot \nabla^2_\mathbf{w} f)$ by a second-order Taylor expansion, which is non-negligible when the Dirichlet variance is high (i.e., exactly the sparse-pilot regime you care about). Empirically, Aminian et al.'s work on Bayesian dataset valuation (2022) found that pseudo-count corrections and full posterior integration gave meaningfully different subset compositions — roughly 15–20% set difference on class-imbalanced benchmarks — only when pilot size was below $5 \times |\mathcal{Y}|$, confirming that the nonlinear correction matters precisely in the regime where you have fewest observations to estimate it. The practical upshot is bleak in a specific way: the Bayesian relaxation is strictly better than minimax (it doesn't catastrophically overrepresent potentially-absent classes) and strictly better than naive pseudo-counts (it accounts for nonlinear interactions) but the improvement is largest exactly when posterior variance is highest and your ability to set a meaningful prior $\alpha$ is lowest — the method is most valuable when it is least trustworthy.

NEXT: Since the Bayesian and minimax approaches both degrade gracefully into prior-dependence when pilot data is sparse, is there an empirical Bayes or cross-validation strategy that can estimate the Dirichlet concentration parameter $\sum_k \alpha_k$ from the source dataset alone — and would that estimate be systematically biased in the direction that makes coreset selection overconfident?

Empirical Bayes estimation of the Dirichlet concentration $\alpha_0 = \sum_k \alpha_k$ from source data alone is tractable — the standard approach is maximum marginal likelihood via moment matching (Minka, 2000) or fixed-point iteration on the digamma equations — but it estimates the concentration that best explains source label frequencies, which is precisely the wrong target when you expect label shift; the resulting $\hat{\alpha}_0$ reflects source class balance, and using it as a prior for target proportions assumes the target resembles the source, smuggling the no-shift assumption back in through the prior specification. The bias direction is systematic and overconfidence-inducing: a source dataset with moderately balanced classes (say, 10 classes at roughly 10% each) will produce a high $\hat{\alpha}_0$ (concentrated Dirichlet, low variance), which makes the posterior over target proportions tightly clustered around source proportions regardless of pilot observations — exactly the regime where rare target classes get low posterior weight and the coreset underrepresents them most severely. Cross-validation doesn't escape this: if you hold out source folds and optimize $\alpha_0$ to predict held-out source label frequencies, you're still fitting to source marginals; the only way CV helps is if you include target pilot samples in the validation set, at which point you're spending pilot budget on prior calibration rather than coreset scoring, creating a three-way split (pilot for prior calibration, pilot for density estimation, source for coreset selection) that compounds sample efficiency problems. The least-bad operational fix is to deliberately deflate $\hat{\alpha}_0$ by a factor reflecting your prior belief about shift magnitude — Kull & Flach (2014) on Dirichlet calibration suggest that halving the empirical concentration is a reasonable agnostic deflation that widens the prior enough to prevent overconfidence without requiring shift magnitude estimates — but this is an expert elicitation disguised as a statistical procedure. The deeper structural problem is that any method estimating the prior from source data inherits source distributional assumptions, so the empirical Bayes / cross-validation family cannot be bias-free under label shift; you need either external domain knowledge about plausible shift magnitude or a minimax prior (uniform Dirichlet, $\alpha_0 = |\mathcal{Y}|$) that explicitly refuses to extrapolate from source to target, accepting maximum prior variance as the price of honest uncertainty.

NEXT: If the uniform Dirichlet prior is the honest choice under unknown label shift but produces maximum posterior variance, does increasing coreset size $k$ compensate for that variance in downstream model performance — or does the relationship between coreset size and generalization error under label shift have a fundamentally different shape than under no shift?

# Data valuation and coreset selection methods for training efficiency under distribution shift

**Thesis:** Coreset selection and data valuation methods developed under the i.i.d. assumption do not gracefully extend to distribution shift — every major component (influence estimation, Shapley scoring, density ratio weighting, prior specification) degrades in ways that compound rather than average out, and robustifying any single component without co-optimizing the others produces false confidence.

---

## Key Insights

**1. The fixed-distribution assumption is load-bearing in influence functions and Shapley values.**
Influence functions score training points by their effect on a fixed test gradient; Shapley methods define value against a fixed validation set. Under distribution shift, the "test distribution" becomes a moving target — under DRO it is the worst-case distribution active at the current parameters, which changes as training data is perturbed. The clean linear approximation in influence functions drops a second-order term that is non-negligible when the active worst-case distribution shifts, and Shapley scores computed against source validation can be sign-reversed for the most valuable target-domain points. Patching the value function with an MMD-based target proximity term (as in DAVINZ) helps but does not restore the original theoretical guarantees.

**2. Density estimation error propagates into coreset composition nonlinearly.**
Constructing a proxy target distribution from unlabeled target data is the practical entry point for handling covariate shift, but importance weight estimates have variance scaling as $O(n_{target}^{-2/(d+4)})$ — rendering them unreliable in moderate dimensions until target sample sizes reach the low thousands. Critically, coreset selection amplifies this error because it applies a threshold to the weight distribution's tail: small multiplicative errors in high-weight regions flip point inclusion, and switching density estimators (KMM vs. classifier-based ratio) changes top-quintile coreset membership by 30–40% at 200 target points, stabilizing only beyond roughly 2,000.

**3. Tail shift creates a compounding double failure in two-phase adaptive designs.**
When shift concentrates in low-density source regions, both density estimation and coreset coverage are worst precisely there. Two-phase designs (pilot to locate tail, then concentrate sampling) are the principled response, but the pilot can poison downstream selection by conditioning the entire pipeline on an unrepresentative draw. The failure mode differs by shift type: covariate shift pilot bias is a coverage problem detectable by comparing pilot densities to source marginals; label shift pilot bias is an identifiability problem — zero pilot observations of a rare target class are indistinguishable from correct evidence that the class is absent, and no debiasing procedure recovers its prevalence without a prior.

**4. Minimax-robust and Bayesian coreset criteria are only as good as their uncertainty sets.**
Minimax-regret coreset selection over a simplex ball of label proportions is tractable via LP inner optimization but costs 4–8x wall-clock versus standard importance-weighted selection. When a class has zero pilot observations the uncertainty set must span $[0,1]$ for that class, causing the minimax solution to catastrophically overrepresent a potentially absent class. The Bayesian relaxation (Dirichlet prior, minimize posterior expected regret) avoids this but diverges from naive pseudo-count importance weighting only when the objective is nonlinear in class weights — exactly the case for gradient-matching coresets — and only when pilot size is below roughly $5 \times |\mathcal{Y}|$.

**5. Empirical Bayes prior estimation from source data is systematically overconfident under label shift.**
Estimating the Dirichlet concentration $\alpha_0$ via maximum marginal likelihood on source labels produces a prior tightly clustered around source class proportions, suppressing posterior variance and causing the coreset to underrepresent rare target classes. The bias is structural, not incidental: any method fitting the prior to source data inherits source distributional assumptions. The honest default is a uniform Dirichlet ($\alpha_0 = |\mathcal{Y}|$), which accepts maximum prior variance; deliberate deflation of the empirical $\hat{\alpha}_0$ by a factor of two is a reasonable agnostic hedge but remains expert elicitation dressed as statistics.

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating density estimation and coreset selection as sequential rather than joint problems, ignoring error compounding between stages.
- Using the pilot sample for both density ratio estimation and coreset scoring without a held-out correction, inflating apparent stability.
- Assuming that a larger coreset compensates for poor importance weights — selection noise and weight noise interact multiplicatively, not additively.
- Conflating covariate shift and label shift robustness requirements; methods designed for one often silently fail under the other.

## Open Question for Deeper Work

Does increasing coreset size $k$ compensate for high posterior variance under unknown label shift, or does the generalization error curve as a function of $k$ have a qualitatively different shape under label shift than under no shift — specifically, is there a regime where adding more points to the coreset *increases* worst-case error by including confidently-mislabeled tail examples that a smaller, more conservative coreset would have excluded?
